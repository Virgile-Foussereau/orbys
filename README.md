# Orbys

Orbys is a visualization tool for asteroids in the Solar System.



## Run Locally

Open `Orbys` directory and launch a local server (for example using VScode and Liver Server). 

## Use offline/online data

By default, offline positions of asteroids are used. If you want to use current time positions for the asteroids, open `mycode.js` and comment the line 16 :


```javascript
offline: "offlineData.json",
```

--> 

```javascript
// offline: "offlineData.json",
```

## Screenshots and demo video

If you are unable to run the project (should not happen), two screenshots and a demo video are provided.
